# Code Explanation Document

### Overview

This code defines a custom React hook `useGetMyUser`, which is responsible for fetching the currently authenticated user's data from an API. It utilizes Auth0 for authentication, React Query for data fetching and caching, and Sonner for displaying toast notifications.

### Key Dependencies:

- **Auth0** (`@auth0/auth0-react`): A popular authentication service that simplifies adding authentication to your applications.
- **React Query** (`react-query`): A library for fetching, caching, and synchronizing server state in React applications.
- **Sonner** (`sonner`): A library for showing toast notifications in a user-friendly manner.

### Breakdown of the Code:

```javascript
import { useAuth0 } from "@auth0/auth0-react";
import { useMutation, useQuery } from "react-query";
import { toast } from "sonner";
```

- **Imports**:
  - `useAuth0` is imported from `@auth0/auth0-react` to provide access to Auth0's authentication methods and user information.
  - `useQuery` and `useMutation` are imported from `react-query` to manage data fetching and server mutations (though only `useQuery` is used in this snippet).
  - `toast` is imported from `sonner` to display notifications for error handling.

```javascript
const API_BASE_URL = import.meta.env.VITE_API_BASE_URL;
```

- **API Base URL**:
  - `API_BASE_URL` is defined as a constant, which is populated from an environment variable. This allows the API endpoint to be configured depending on the environment (e.g., development, staging, production).

```javascript
export const useGetMyUser = () => {
  const { getAccessTokenSilently } = useAuth0();
```

- **Custom Hook `useGetMyUser`**:
  - This is a custom React hook, which will encapsulate the logic for fetching the current user's data.
  - `getAccessTokenSilently` is extracted from the `useAuth0` hook. This method is used to retrieve the user's access token without prompting them to log in again, as long as they are already authenticated.

```javascript
const getMyUserRequest = async () => {
  const accessToken = await getAccessTokenSilently();

  const response = await fetch(`${API_BASE_URL}/api/my/user`, {
    method: "GET",
    headers: {
      Authorization: `Bearer ${accessToken}`,
      "Content-Type": "application/json",
    },
  });

  if (!response.ok) {
    throw new Error("Failed to fetch user");
  }

  return response.json();
};
```

- **`getMyUserRequest` Function**:
  - This asynchronous function fetches the current user's data from the API.
  - `getAccessTokenSilently()` retrieves the access token needed to authorize the API request.
  - A `GET` request is made to the `/api/my/user` endpoint of the API, with the Authorization header set to `Bearer ${accessToken}`.
  - If the API responds with a status code outside the range of 2xx, the function throws an error.
  - Upon successful response, the function returns the parsed JSON data.

```javascript
const {
  data: currentUser,
  isLoading,
  error,
} = useQuery("fetchCurrentUser", getMyUserRequest);
```

- **React Query's `useQuery`**:
  - `useQuery` is used to manage the data fetching for the user's data. It accepts a unique key (`"fetchCurrentUser"`) and the function to fetch the data (`getMyUserRequest`).
  - The `useQuery` hook returns several values:
    - `data`: The fetched data, here renamed to `currentUser`.
    - `isLoading`: A boolean indicating whether the data is still being fetched.
    - `error`: Any error that occurred during the fetch.

```javascript
if (error) {
  toast.error(error.toString());
}
```

- **Error Handling**:
  - If an error occurs during the fetch (as indicated by the `error` value), a toast notification is shown using `toast.error`.

```javascript
  return { currentUser, isLoading };
};
```

- **Return Statement**:
  - The hook returns the `currentUser` data and the `isLoading` state. These can be used by any component that calls `useGetMyUser` to access the user's data and display a loading state if needed.

### Summary

The `useGetMyUser` hook simplifies the process of fetching and handling the authenticated user's data in a React application. By leveraging Auth0 for authentication and React Query for data management, this hook provides a clean and reusable solution for managing user data, complete with error handling through toast notifications.
